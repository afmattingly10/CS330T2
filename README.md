How do I approach designing software?
  The first step is to relax and make a plan. Test throughout and make sure youre following the guidelines.
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
  This project helped me learn so much about graphics and thinking outside the box.
What design process did you follow for your project work?
  I liked to break the project up into small parts and think and plan out each step. 
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
  I will keep breaking the project into smaller pieces and making sure I understand and have a plan.
How do I approach developing programs?
  Create a sort of psuedocode and flow diagrams to see how things work together.
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
  I planned out what needed to go in the scene and worked on each object indipendently. 
How did iteration factor into your development?
  Iteration worked because there were several objects that followed the same guidlines like making several trees. 
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
  The milestones helped by providing me a guideline on how I was doing on the project.
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
  This can help me by understand the work I am doing for the goverment more. 
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
  This can help me in future classes if I decided to design more.
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
  Professioanly I do not see myself using graphics, but the ability to understand is important.
